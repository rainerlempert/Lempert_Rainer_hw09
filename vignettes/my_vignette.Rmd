```

## Usage

Look at what my functions can do!
```{r}
square(1:10)
cube(1:10)
pow(1:10,3)
boxcox(4,3)
```

They work with the `apply` family as well!
```{r}
my_list <- list(1:10, 0.5, 26)

lapply(my_list, square)
lapply(my_list, boxcox, lambda=3)
```

## Errors

If you put a string into any of the functions the spit out an error message!
```{r}
cube("1:10")
pow(1:10,"why one would put a character here is beyond me")
```

In addition, if your value is less than or equal to zero for `boxcox` you also get an error message!
```{r}
boxcox(-500000,3)
```
